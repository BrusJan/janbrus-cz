				<h3>Jan Brus</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/jb_family.jpg" alt="My family" /></span>
				<p>Hello, <br />
					My name is Jan Brus. I'm a full-stack software developer since 2010. At this time i focus on Angular
					and you could consider me 'ninja' developer. I have encountered many different programming languages
					throughout my career.
					I live with my wife and 4 girls in a house in a small willage in Czechia (Morava region).</p>
				<p><strong>Personality: </strong>I'm very creative person, open minded and family oriented. My career so far has
					been mostly corporate employment, working in teams. Latest assigment and side hustles have been
					individual work and i have no trouble with either working in team or taking care of everything
					myself or even team leading other members. Pees consider me very friendly and helpful.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Experiences: </strong>My programming experiences are very broad. I have started in C# .Net (first
					ASP,
					then WPF) doing some WordPress and web design on the side (3-years). Then i continued working mostly
					with databases (1-year). After that i got my most progressive job which was TeamLeader of C# Scrum
					team (2-years). For family reasons I had to change jobs and switched to java (1-year) and was
					finishing my thesis in PHP/Kotlin. Shortly after that my manager offered me to work on a project as
					full-stack developer. I did not hesitate a bit. Currently I'm working on Angular project with java
					backend as solo developer. I'm doing the whole development process, from specifying user stories
					with product owner, handling jira, testing, deployment, support.</p>
				<p><u>Personal life: </u>After my bachelors studies in IT I have moved to Prague to find a software
					developer job. I lived there for 3 years when i met my now wife. We lived together in or near Prague
					and started a family there. I also finished my studies and got Ing. degree (which is equivalent to
					Master of Science in engineering in the US), but my original family was located in Moravia so we
					moved to my roots because it was better for our first child to have a grandparents closer. We live
					in Moravia region since then, got ourselves a house and are very happy in here.</p>
