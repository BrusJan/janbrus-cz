				<h3>Jan Brus</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/jb_family.jpg" alt="My family" /></span>
				<p>Hello, <br />
					My name is Jan Brus. I'm a full-stack software developer since 2010. At this time i focus on Angular
					and Flutter and you could consider me ninja developer, but the most experiences I have are C# and
					SQL.
					I live with my wife and 3 girls in a house in a small willage in Czechia (Morava region).</p>
				<p><u>Personality: </u>I'm very creative person, open minded and family oriented. My career so far has
					been mostly corporate employment, working in teams. Latest assigment and side hustles have been
					individual work and i have no trouble with either working in team or taking care of everything
					myself.
				</p>
				<p><u>Experiences: </u>My programming experiences are very broad. I have started in C# .Net (first ASP,
					then WPF) doing some WordPress and web design on the side (3-years). Then i continued working mostly
					with databases (1-year). After that i got my most progressive job which was TeamLeader of C# Scrum
					team (2-years). For family reasons I had to change jobs and switched to java (1-year) and was
					finishing my thesis in PHP/Kotlin. Shortly after that my manager offered me to work on a project as
					full-stack developer. I did not hesitate a bit. Currently I'm working on Angular project with java
					backend as the sole developer.</p>
				<p><u>Personal life: </u>After my bachelors studies in IT I have moved to Prague to find a software
					developer job. I lived there for 3 years when i met my now wife. We lived together in or near Prague
					and started a family there. I also finished my studies and got Ing. degree (which is equivalent to
					Master of Science in engineering in the US), but my original family was located in Moravia so we
					moved to my roots because it was better for our first child to have a grandparents closer. We live
					in Moravia region since then, got ourselves a house and are very happy in here.</p>

				<p>This project teached me how to do Agile Scrum properly and how to lead a team of 4 developers and 1
					tester. Application was meant for internal users which were mostly analysts entering and working
					with data they gathered about sales of technological products. The application was jokingly reffered
					to as "excel on steroids". There was a lot of use of sheets, data tables, charts, forms and data
					transfers. We were doing all the Scrumy things
					you are supposed to do. My role was 50% leader, 50%
					developer. It was a great experience.</p>
